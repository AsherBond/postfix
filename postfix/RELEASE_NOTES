This is the Postfix 3.8 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-3.7.x where 3=major
release number, 7=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-3.8-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 3.6 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-3.7
before proceeding.

Bugfix for messages not delivered after "warning: Unexpected record type 'X'
============================================================================

Due to a bug introduced in Postfix 3.7.0, a message could falsely
be flagged as corrupt with "warning: Unexpected record type 'X'".

Such messages were moved to the "corrupt" queue directory, where
they may still be found. See below for instructions to deal with
these falsely flagged messages.

This problem could happen for messages with 5000 or more recipients,
or with fewer recipients on a busy mail server. The problem was
first reported by Frank Brendel, and the error conditions were
reproduced by John Alex.

Please see https://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.7.3 for
instructions to identify falsely flagged messages in the Postfix
queue, and what actions may be taken.

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20220507
===========================================

Most global/mkmap*.[hc] files have moved to the util directory;
only global/mkmap_proxy.* remains. The old file organization was
designed before support for dynamically-loadable databases was
added, and the code suffered from complexity.
