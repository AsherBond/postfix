This is the Postfix 3.9 experimental release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-3.8.x where 3=major
release number, 8=minor release number, x=patchlevel. The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-3.9-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day). Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 3.7 or earlier, please read RELEASE_NOTES-3.8
before proceeding.

Major changes with snapshot 20230522
====================================

Preliminary support for OpenSSL configuration files, primarily
OpenSSL 1.1.1b and later. This introduces two new parameters
"tls_config_file" and "tls_config_name", which can be used to limit
collateral damage from OS distributions that crank up security to
11, increasing the number of plaintext email deliveries. Details
are in the postconf(5) manpage under "tls_config_file" and
"tls_config_name".

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20230419
===========================================

The MySQL client default characterset is now configurable with the
"charset" configuration file attribute. The default is "utf8mb4",
consistent with the MySQL 8.0 built-in default, but different from
earlier MySQL versions where the built-in default was "latin1".
