This is the Postfix 3.8 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-3.7.x where 3=major
release number, 7=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-3.8-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 3.6 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-3.7
before proceeding.

Bugfix for messages not delivered after "warning: Unexpected record type 'X'
============================================================================

Due to a bug introduced in Postfix 3.7, a message could falsely
be flagged as corrupt with "warning: Unexpected record type 'X'".

Such messages were moved to the "corrupt" queue directory, where
they may still be found. See below for instructions to deal with
these falsely flagged messages.

This could happen for messages with 5000 or more recipients, or
with fewer recipients on a busy mail server. The problem was first 
reported by Frank Brendel, reproduced by John Alex. 

A file in the "corrupt" queue directory may be inspected with the
command "postcat /var/spool/postfix/corrupt/<filename>. If delivery
of the file is still desired, the file can be moved back to
/var/spool/postfix/incoming after updating Postfix and executing
"postfix reload".

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20220507
===========================================

Most global/mkmap*.[hc] files have moved to the util directory;
only global/mkmap_proxy.* remains. The old file organization was
designed before support for dynamically-loadable databases was
added, and the code suffered from complexity.
